# The Fight.ID Partnership with UFC

## Public announcement and collaboration

The UFC and **Fight.ID** have publicly announced a multi-year collaboration aimed at uniting MMA fans with Web3 experiences built around identity, loyalty, and ownership. The announcement outlines a roadmap that includes a loyalty layer anchored in Fight.ID, the Prize$Fight bonus program for fighters, and the FightGear premium apparel line.

It includes an explicit statement of support from Grant Norris-Jones, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Partnerships at TKO, affirming the UFC's commitment to backing the **Fight.ID ecosystem** over the coming years. This public validation provides clarity to partners, athletes, and fans that Fight.ID is being developed in concert with the UFC's long-term fan engagement strategy.

**Important distinction:** The UFC partnership is with **Fight.ID** (the digital identity and fan engagement platform). **$FIGHT is an access token** built by the Fight Foundation that enables projects to access Fight.ID's authenticated community and enables fans to access premium experiences across the network. The UFC does not endorse $FIGHT or any cryptocurrency.

## Scope, placements, and distribution signal

The partnership provides recurring visibility for Fight.ID and $FIGHT across UFC's digital footprint and during fight-week moments. In practice, this means Fight surfaces can be promoted in the same rhythm that UFC cards are announced, marketed, and broadcast. Fight can leverage pre-fight storytelling, weigh-in day buzz, live event conversation, and post-fight highlights to drive fans into simple, low-friction actions: claim a fight ID, earn FP points through quests and campaigns, and learn how to use $FIGHT for access, governance, and community participation. This predictable "event cadence" is a distribution system in itself, turning every card into a funnel for identity claims and ongoing engagement.

## Why this matters strategically

Partnering with one of the world's most valuable sports brands compresses customer acquisition costs (CAC), improves conversion rates, and increases lifetime value (LTV). Instead of spending to manufacture attention, Fight taps into an existing global audience with high intent and clear behaviors around research, debate, and viewing.

UFC's cultural relevance anchors Fight squarely in mainstream sports engagement rather than a narrow crypto niche, which is essential for onboarding non-crypto users at scale. Over time, this alignment compounds: as more fans claim FightIDs and accumulate FP points, Fight gains a larger addressable base for new utilities, better cohort retention, and richer cross-selling into merch, tickets, and communities.

## How value accrues to $FIGHT

UFC-amplified activations translate directly into $FIGHT usage. When fans participate in the ecosystem through quests (funded by projects burning $FIGHT for FP), stake to enter fighter communities, or transact for merch and tickets, they generate on-chain activity and fee flows denominated in $FIGHT. Partner demand creates direct burn pressure as projects burn $FIGHT to acquire FP for distribution. Those fees and burns are routed to the DAO treasury under transparent policies. The DAO then deploys a portion of net revenues to support the token and ecosystem through DAO-directed programs, while also funding ecosystem grants and growth programs that bring in new users. This creates a closed-loop system: UFC distribution drives engagement; engagement drives fees and burns; fees fund treasury programs and further growth; and growth increases utility and demand for $FIGHT. The more Fight activates around UFC events, the stronger and more predictable this value-accrual flywheel becomes.
