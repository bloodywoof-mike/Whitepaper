# $FIGHT (Ownership)

## What it is

$FIGHT is the Solana-based access token that enables dual access across the Fight ecosystem: **projects burn $FIGHT to access the authenticated Fight.ID community**, and **fans hold $FIGHT to access premium experiences, governance rights, and platform features**. It unifies identity-driven access, reputation-driven status, and the utilities both partners and fans care about—partner distribution campaigns, governance participation, fighter communities, prediction markets, Prize$Fight bounties, and FightGear commerce.

## Why it matters

A single token across multiple UFC-supported surfaces lowers friction for newcomers and concentrates value capture for the community. Instead of scattering attention and spend across isolated apps, $FIGHT creates one programmable loop where the same currency unlocks access, pays fees, and represents voice in governance. That simplicity is critical for onboarding mainstream fans at UFC scale.

## How value accrues to $FIGHT

**Partner burns** — projects burn $FIGHT to acquire FP for distribution through quests and campaigns, creating direct, permanent supply reduction as ecosystem adoption grows.

**Access & governance demand** — holding $FIGHT unlocks premium fight experiences, exclusive content, and platform features; staking for governance rights locks supply and increases as treasury scale grows.

**Community & utility fees** — fighter community memberships and upgrades, staking locks with FP boosts, prediction market fees (via licensed partners), merch/ticket rails, and sponsorship flows generate recurring $FIGHT-denominated revenues. Under DAO policy, portions fund treasury programs and growth grants.

**UFC distribution** gives us a reliable cadence of events, making these sinks recur week after week: more activations → more $FIGHT usage → more fees and burns → tightening the feedback loop between engagement and token value.
