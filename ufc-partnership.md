# The UFC Partnership

## Public announcement and endorsement

The UFC and Fight.ID have publicly announced a multi-year collaboration aimed at uniting MMA fans with Web3 experiences built around identity, loyalty, and ownership. The announcement outlines a roadmap that includes a loyalty layer anchored in Fight.ID, the Prize$Fight bonus program for fighters, and the FightGear premium apparel line aligned with the FIGHT ecosystem. It also includes an explicit statement of support from Grant Norris-Jones, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Partnerships at TKO, affirming the UFC's commitment to backing the Fight.ID ecosystem over the coming years. This public validation provides clarity to partners, athletes, and fans that Fight is being developed in concert with the UFC's long-term fan engagement strategy.

## Scope, placements, and distribution signal

The partnership provides recurring visibility for Fight.ID and $FIGHT across UFC's digital footprint and during fight-week moments. In practice, this means Fight surfaces can be promoted in the same rhythm that UFC cards are announced, marketed, and broadcast. Fight can leverage pre-fight storytelling, weigh-in day buzz, live event conversation, and post-fight highlights to drive fans into simple, low-friction actions: claim a fight ID, earn FP points, and learn how to use $FIGHT inside prediction markets, staking, and fighter communities. This predictable "event cadence" is a distribution system in itself, turning every card into a funnel for identity claims and ongoing engagement.

## Why this matters strategically

Partnering with one of the world's most valuable sports brands compresses customer acquisition costs (CAC), improves conversion rates, and increases lifetime value (LTV). Instead of spending to manufacture attention, Fight taps into an existing global audience with high intent and clear behaviors around research, debate, and viewing.

UFC's cultural relevance anchors Fight squarely in mainstream sports fandom rather than a narrow crypto niche, which is essential for onboarding non-crypto users at scale. Over time, this alignment compounds: as more fans claim FightIDs and accumulate FP points, Fight gains a larger addressable base for new utilities, better cohort retention, and richer cross-selling into merch, tickets, and communities.

## How value accrues to $FIGHT

UFC-amplified activations translate directly into $FIGHT usage. When fans join prediction markets, stake to enter fighter communities, or transact for merch and tickets, they generate on-chain activity and fee flows denominated in $FIGHT. Those fees are routed to the DAO treasury under transparent policies. The DAO then deploys a portion of net revenues to buybacks and burns, reducing circulating supply over time, while also funding ecosystem grants and growth programs that bring in new users. This creates a closed-loop system: UFC distribution drives engagement; engagement drives fees; fees fund buybacks/burns and further growth; and growth increases utility and demand for $FIGHT. The more Fight activates around UFC events, the stronger and more predictable this value-accrual flywheel becomes.
