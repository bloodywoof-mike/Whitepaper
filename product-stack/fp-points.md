# FP Points (Reputation)

## What it is

FP (Fighting Force) points are non-transferable reputation. Fans earn FP by completing quests, participating in events, contributing content and governance, and performing in prediction markets. FP is intentionally not a tradable asset; it is a scoreboard of meaningful participation tied to a user's FightID. FP unlocks tiers, gates premium experiences, and boosts staking multipliers in fighter communities and ecosystem programs.

## Why it matters

Reputation shifts incentives from short-term farming to long-term engagement. Because FP cannot be sold, the only way to "win" is to show up consistently—watch cards, make informed predictions, back fighters, participate in community decisions, and help the ecosystem grow. This design reduces churn, improves cohort quality, and rewards authentic behavior over mercenary airdrop hunting. It also helps us run fairer allowlists, raffles, and premium access since FP reflects real contribution.

## How value accrues to $FIGHT

FP makes $FIGHT-denominated utilities stickier and more valuable. Higher FP boosts staking yields, unlocks better community perks, and can grant priority access to limited drops—creating strong reasons to keep staking and spending $FIGHT.

Minimum-FP gates can also be applied to fighter clubs or tournaments, concentrating activity among committed users who are more likely to deposit, re-enter, and compound participation.

**Net effect**: FP raises the frequency and depth of interactions that generate $FIGHT fees and memberships, strengthening the DAO's buyback/burn engine.
