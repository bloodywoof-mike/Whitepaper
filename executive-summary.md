# Executive Summary

Fight is a licensed Web3 ecosystem that turns combat-sports fandom into ownership. It runs on three pillars:

1. **Identity (FightID)**: a portable, on-chain identity for fans and fighters.
2. **Reputation (FP points)**: non-transferable "Fighting Points" points that reflect participation and unlock utility.
3. **Ownership ($FIGHT)**: a Solana-based token used across the ecosystem for access, staking, governance, fees, and rewards.

$FIGHT is an IP token. It is supported by the UFC through licensing and sponsorship relationships held by Concept Labs, a core contributor to the project. UFC and Fight.ID publicly announced a multi-year collaboration to grow UFC's digital fanbase with loyalty experiences, Prize$Fight fighter bonuses, and FightGear premium apparel aligned to the FIGHT ecosystem.

**Flagship utility: Prediction Markets**—a token-based, fantasy-style product synchronized to the UFC fight calendar. This utility, combined with fighter communities, merch/ticket rails, and partner activations, is designed so value accrues to $FIGHT via fees → DAO treasury → buybacks/burns and growth grants.

## Why this matters

UFC gives Fight distribution and cultural legitimacy at global scale. Each fight week is an acquisition moment that drives fans through the funnel: **UFC reach → FightID → FP → $FIGHT**. Our long-term ambition is to onboard 700M+ mainstream fans into Web3 through simple, rewarding experiences.
