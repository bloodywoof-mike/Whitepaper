# Tokenomics

## Overview and supply

$FIGHT is a Solana (SPL) IP token with a **fixed maximum supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens**. At the Token Generation Event (TGE), the initial price is **$0.0500**, implying a **$500,000,000 FDV**. Circulating supply at TGE is **~9.35% (935,000,000 $FIGHT)**. All other tokens remain locked and vest according to the schedules below. This structure establishes clear scarcity from day one while leaving ample runway for long-term ecosystem incentives.

## Composition at TGE

Circulating tokens at launch consist of:
- **Community**: 5% of its allocation (285,000,000 $FIGHT)
- **Liquidity**: 100% of its allocation (650,000,000 $FIGHT)

Every other category (Team, Investors, Advisors, etc..) begins fully locked. This mix enables healthy price discovery and market depth, while ensuring that short-term supply is driven by user incentives and liquidity—not early unlocks.

## Why this design matters

The launch mix reduces slippage for mainstream users on day one, avoids reflexive sell pressure from large unlocks, and directs most early supply toward utility (community programs) and accessibility (liquidity). As product surfaces (prediction markets, fighter communities, merch/tickets) come online, that accessible supply is used to participate—creating transaction flow that the DAO can redirect toward buybacks/burns and growth grants.

## Allocation and Release

### Community — 57.0% (5,700,000,000 $FIGHT)

**Release schedule**: 5% at TGE, then 1/48 of the remainder monthly over 48 months.

**Purpose**: Airdrops, staking rewards, ecosystem grants, and community programs that bring fans, fighters, and builders into the loop.

**Why it matters**: A large community allocation lets us reward real participation over multiple seasons rather than burning through incentives in the first months. It aligns with UFC's event cadence and provides consistent reasons for new and returning fans to engage.

**How value accrues to $FIGHT**: Community incentives increase entries, staking, and commerce that generate $FIGHT-denominated fees. Those fees flow to the DAO and are used for buybacks/burns and future growth programs—linking participation directly to token value.

### Core Team — 15.0% (1,500,000,000 $FIGHT)

**Release schedule**: 12-month cliff, then 1/24 monthly over the next 24 months.

**Why it matters**: A one-year cliff eliminates early supply shocks from contributors and ensures the team is aligned with multi-season delivery.

**How value accrues to $FIGHT**: Teams are incentivized to build fee-producing utilities (prediction markets, staking programs, communities). As those utilities grow, the DAO can allocate more cash flow to buybacks/burns, strengthening the token while contributors vest gradually.

### Advisors — 4.0% (400,000,000 $FIGHT)

**Release schedule**: 12-month lockup, then 1/18 monthly over 18 months.

**Why it matters**: Strategic help is rewarded without introducing early sell pressure. Advisors are encouraged to focus on distribution, listings, and partnerships that compound over time.

**How value accrues to $FIGHT**: Advisors help open new surfaces where $FIGHT is used (exchanges, partners, commerce). More surfaces mean more sinks and fees, which the DAO recirculates into buybacks/burns and ecosystem grants.

### Liquidity — 6.5% (650,000,000 $FIGHT)

**Release schedule**: 100% unlocked at TGE.

**Why it matters**: Day-one depth reduces slippage and enables mainstream fans to acquire and use $FIGHT without friction.

**How value accrues to $FIGHT**: Healthy routing and minimal slippage encourage participation in prediction markets, communities, and commerce. Each transaction generates fees that flow to the DAO for buybacks/burns and growth, creating a self-reinforcing loop.
