# Ecosystem Utility

The Fight ecosystem integrates multiple utility surfaces that turn combat-sports engagement into recurring participation. These utilities may be built by partners or developed in-house, all integrating the Fight standard: **FightID** (identity), **FP** (reputation), and **$FIGHT** (ownership). Each utility ties to UFC's event cadence and generates $FIGHT-denominated activity.

---

## 1. Partner Ecosystem Access (Flagship)

**Projects burn $FIGHT to acquire FP** that they distribute through quests, campaigns, and challenges to incentivize the Fight.ID community. This B2B model creates direct demand for $FIGHT as ecosystem partners pay to access the engaged fanbase. Projects use FP rewards to drive user actions—completing quests, engaging with content, participating in events—creating a flywheel where partner demand fuels token burns and fan participation earns reputation.

**Why it matters:** Converts Fight.ID's audience into a monetizable asset. Partners get access to an authenticated, reputation-scored community; fans earn FP through meaningful participation; $FIGHT becomes the required currency for ecosystem access.

**Value accrual:** Partners burn $FIGHT to acquire FP → permanent supply reduction. As Fight.ID scales and more partners seek distribution, burn demand grows, directly tightening circulating supply while expanding utility.

---

## 2. Access & Governance

**Holding $FIGHT unlocks premium experiences:** exclusive fight content, early access to features, platform perks, and priority in community programs. Token holders also participate in governance, voting on treasury allocations, emissions schedules, ecosystem grants, and protocol parameters through the DAO.

**Why it matters:** Creates baseline utility independent of any single feature. Holding = access + voice. As the ecosystem expands, access value compounds (more partners, more content, more perks); governance influence grows with treasury scale.

**Value accrual:** Holding demand increases as utility surfaces expand. Staked tokens for governance rights lock supply. DAO-directed buyback/burn programs directly reduce circulating tokens using protocol revenues.

---

## 3. Fighter Communities & Staking

On-chain fan clubs requiring **$FIGHT stakes** for membership. Each fighter's community offers exclusive content, AMAs, watch-alongs, merch drops, prediction tournaments, and Prize$Fight bounties. Membership maintained through active stakes; upgrades via increased stake or higher FP.

**Core mechanics:**
- **Dynamic entry pricing:** Stakes rise as membership grows, rewarding early supporters.
- **Reward routing:** Join fees and community revenues flow to existing members (pro-rata) and the DAO treasury for buybacks/burns and grants.
- **FP multipliers:** High-FP members receive boosted yields, priority access, and enhanced community perks.

**Value accrual:** Staking locks supply; community fees generate $FIGHT-denominated revenues routed to DAO for buybacks/burns; FP boosts increase stake duration. UFC fight-week moments drive new memberships → higher entry prices → more fees → growth and burns.

---

## 4. Prediction Markets (Partner-Operated)

**Fantasy-style games** (not wagering on fight results) offered through partnership with a licensed operator. Fans use **$FIGHT** to enter skill-based challenges covering MMA culture: card announcements, walkout aesthetics, media moments, training camps, and creator content.

Entries scored against objective, pre-published resolution sources. Fans compete in seasonal leaderboards, club tournaments, and creator-hosted games rewarding high-FP performance.

**Value accrual:** Maker/taker/settlement fees collected in $FIGHT, routed to DAO treasury for buybacks/burns, liquidity, and grants. Seasonal mechanics increase entry frequency.

---

## 5. Additional Utility Surfaces

### FightGear

Premium combat-sports lifestyle brand featuring limited-run capsule drops, fighter collaborations, and event-themed collections. Access token-gated through **FightID**, with early windows for **$FIGHT** holders and high-**FP** members. Checkout supports $FIGHT alongside conventional payment rails.

**Why it matters:** Apparel acts as a viral surface extending the brand into the real world. Converts casual awareness into **FightID** claims and repeat engagement. Traditional apparel business bringing revenue and profits to the ecosystem.

**Value accrual:** Purchases, holder discounts, and royalties denominated in **$FIGHT**. Programmable share of net proceeds flows to **DAO treasury** for **buybacks/burns**, builder grants, and future drops.

---

### Prize$Fight

Programmable prize-pool framework for **fighter bonuses**, **fan challenges**, and **event-based bounties** (e.g., "Finish of the Night," "Fan MVP," "Underdog Upset"). Pools funded by sponsors, community initiatives, or DAO allocations. Disbursed transparently on-chain with **Athlete Council** guidance.

**Why it matters:** Turns fan support into tangible rewards for athletes. Aligns incentives—fighters rewarded for memorable performances, fans for engagement and prediction skill, sponsors for measurable activation. What benefits fighters benefits fans, and vice versa.

**Value accrual:** Funding, pledges, and entry fees denominated in **$FIGHT**. Protocol fee routes to treasury for **buybacks/burns** and future campaigns. Clusters around fight week, driving new **FightID** sign-ups and repeat token usage. Some bonuses time-locked until fighter retirement, reducing float.

---

### FightHub

Network of partner apps, leagues, and utilities integrating the Fight standard: **FightID** (identity), **FP** (reputation), and **$FIGHT** (ownership). Partners use SDKs/APIs to honor user identity and status, accept $FIGHT for access/fees, and feed engagement data back into the ecosystem.

**Why it matters:** Expands where fan identity and reputation matter without fragmentation. Unified layer lets fans carry their handle, FP, and access rights everywhere. Partners tap into UFC-synchronized distribution and engaged audience, lowering integration cost and accelerating go-to-market.

**Value accrual:** Each integration adds new **utility surfaces** and **fee streams** (subscriptions, upgrades, entries, settlement) denominated in **$FIGHT**. Standard revenue-share routes portions to **DAO treasury** for **buybacks/burns**, liquidity programs, and builder grants seeding the next wave of partners.

---

## Revenue Model & Value Routing

All utility surfaces generate $FIGHT-denominated fees flowing to the DAO treasury under transparent policies.

| Utility | Revenue Streams | Cadence |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Prediction Markets** | Maker/taker/settlement fees, seasonal passes | Weekly (fight-week) |
| **Fighter Communities** | Join/upgrade fees, tournaments | Ongoing |
| **FightGear** | Sales, royalties, holder discounts | Event & drop cycles |
| **Prize$Fight** | Protocol fee on funding & entries | Event-based |
| **FightHub Partners** | Revenue-share from integrations | Variable |
| **NFTs & Collectibles** | Sales, marketplace fees, royalties | Event-aligned |
| **Ticketing & Merch** | Transaction fees, partner shares | Event cycles |

### Value Routing

Portions of **net revenues** flow to the **DAO treasury** in **$FIGHT**. The DAO allocates proceeds to:

- **Buybacks and burns** — reduces circulating supply over time
- **Ecosystem grants** — drives new product surfaces and user growth
- **Liquidity operations** — smooth onboarding for mainstream fans

### The Flywheel

UFC's cadence supplies distribution → FightID and FP convert attention into value-creating actions → $FIGHT-denominated revenues fund buybacks/burns and next-wave growth → compounding cycle where **real usage directly supports token value**, card after card, season after season.
