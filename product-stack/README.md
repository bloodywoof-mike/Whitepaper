# Product Stack: Identity, Reputation, Ownership

Fight's product stack is built on three interconnected layers:

- [!badge variant="primary" text="FightID"] **Identity** — portable, on-chain identity for fans and fighters
- [!badge variant="success" text="FP Points"] **Reputation** — non-transferable points that reflect participation
- [!badge variant="warning" text="$FIGHT"] **Ownership** — Access token enabling dual access: projects→fans, fans→experiences

Each layer reinforces the others, creating a flywheel that drives engagement and value accrual.
