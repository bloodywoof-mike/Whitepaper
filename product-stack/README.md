# Product Stack: Identity, Reputation, Ownership

Fight's product stack is built on three interconnected layers:

- **FightID (Identity)** — portable, on-chain identity for fans and fighters
- **FP Points (Reputation)** — non-transferable points that reflect participation
- **$FIGHT (Ownership)** — Access token enabling dual access: projects→fans, fans→experiences

Each layer reinforces the others, creating a flywheel that drives engagement and value accrual.
