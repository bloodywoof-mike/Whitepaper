# Executive Summary

**Fight is the Web3 home of combat sports** — a licensed ecosystem built by the developers behind UFC Strike and powered by **Fight.ID**, the official digital gateway for MMA and fight culture. It runs on three pillars:

1. **Identity (FightID)** — a portable, on-chain identity for fans and fighters.  
2. **Reputation (FP points)** — non-transferable "Fighting Points" that reflect participation and unlock ecosystem utility.  
3. **Ownership ($FIGHT)** — a Solana-based access token that enables dual access: projects burn $FIGHT to access the Fight.ID community; fans hold $FIGHT to access premium experiences, governance rights, and platform features.  

**Fight.ID is a partner of the UFC.** The UFC and Fight.ID have publicly announced a multi-year collaboration to grow the UFC's digital fanbase with loyalty experiences, Prize$Fight fighter bonuses, and FightGear premium apparel.

**Core Utilities:**
- **Holding $FIGHT grants access** to premium fight experiences, exclusive content, and platform features.
- **Governance participation** through token-holder voting on ecosystem priorities, treasury allocations, and protocol parameters.
- **Flagship: Partner Ecosystem Access** — projects burn $FIGHT to acquire FP that they distribute through quests, incentivizing participation within the Fight.ID community and creating a direct value loop between ecosystem activity and token demand.
- **Fighter communities, merchandise rails, prediction markets (via licensed partners), and event-driven rewards** channel ecosystem activity through transparent, DAO-governed fee flows and treasury programs.

## Why this matters

Fight.ID's partnership with the UFC provides real distribution and cultural legitimacy at global scale. Each fight week becomes an acquisition moment that drives fans through the ecosystem funnel:  
**UFC reach → FightID → FP → $FIGHT**.  

With a team embedded deep in the sport and real distribution through the Fight.ID partner network, Fight is onboarding millions into a unified, high-energy, tokenized combat-sports economy. **$FIGHT turns every card, every storyline, and every fighter moment into tradable, community-driven participation** — the digital pulse of the fight world.

Under **DAO treasury policies**, portions of net protocol revenues may be allocated to ecosystem operations, community grants, and other programs approved through on-chain governance. These allocations are **not intended as investment returns or price support** and may be modified or discontinued at any time based on community decisions and program priorities.
