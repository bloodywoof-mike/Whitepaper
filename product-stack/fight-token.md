# $FIGHT (Ownership)

## What it is

$FIGHT is the Solana-based IP token that powers entries, staking, community membership, governance, and transaction fees across Fight experiences. It is the common medium that unifies identity-driven access, reputation-driven status, and the utilities fans care about—prediction markets, fighter communities, Prize$Fight bounties, and FightGear commerce. Governance rights allow token holders to shape programs, budgets, and integrations as the ecosystem decentralizes.

## Why it matters

A single token across multiple UFC-supported surfaces lowers friction for newcomers and concentrates value capture for the community. Instead of scattering attention and spend across isolated apps, $FIGHT creates one programmable loop where the same currency unlocks access, pays fees, and represents voice in governance. That simplicity is critical for onboarding mainstream fans at UFC scale.

## How value accrues to $FIGHT

Every new surface adds new token sinks—prediction fees, community memberships and upgrades, staking locks with FP boosts, merch/ticket rails, and sponsorship flows. Under DAO policy, a portion of net revenues funds buybacks and burns, while another portion funds growth grants and liquidity programs that drive the next wave of users. Because UFC distribution gives us a reliable cadence of events, these sinks recur week after week: more activations → more $FIGHT usage → more fees → more buybacks/burns and growth—tightening the feedback loop between fandom and token value.
